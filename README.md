# Problem Statement Tackled: SM5 - Clustering a Huge Library

Our challenge was to devise a computationally efficient clustering approach for the extensive Moses dataset, containing 1.5 million molecules in SMILES format. The goal was to maintain high accuracy in grouping similar data points while minimizing computational resources, ensuring scalability for large datasets and real-time applications.

## Innovative Solutions Implemented:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Extraction:**
   - Conducted EDA to understand the dataset and extract meaningful features.
   - Utilized statistical methods to identify and retain only the most relevant features, optimizing the subsequent clustering process.

2. **Diverse Clustering Algorithms:**
   - Employed a variety of clustering algorithms, including:
     - DBSCAN
     - Mini Batch-KMeans
     - BIRCH
     - OPTICS
   - This diverse set of algorithms helped extract meaningful patterns from the vast molecular data, improving the accuracy of the clustering process.

3. **Efficiency Optimization Strategies:**
   - Implemented meticulous optimization strategies to enhance computational efficiency.
   - Ensured robust performance even with large datasets, addressing scalability concerns and enabling the application in real-time scenarios.

4. **Ensemble Approach:**
   - Developed an ensemble approach by combining the strengths of multiple clustering algorithms.
   - This ensemble method facilitated achieving superior clustering results by leveraging the complementary strengths of different algorithms.

These innovative solutions collectively addressed the challenges posed by the extensive Moses dataset, providing a computationally efficient and accurate clustering framework for large-scale molecular data.
